# Multi-level Dropdown and Simple Submit Form

This code demonstrates the implementation of a multi-level dropdown menu and a simple submit form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The multi-level dropdown allows users to select options from multiple levels, such as selecting a province, city, and district, while the simple submit form captures user input and performs basic validation before submitting the form.

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Multi-level Dropdown

The multi-level dropdown allows users to select options from different levels, such as provinces, cities, and districts. The dropdowns are populated dynamically using JavaScript based on the user's selection.

- **Dropdown Levels:**
  - Province: Select the desired province from the dropdown.
  - City: Once a province is selected, the dropdown will populate with cities related to that province.
  - District: After selecting a city, the dropdown will display districts within the selected city.

## Simple Submit Form

The simple submit form captures user input and performs basic validation before submitting the form.

- **Form Fields:**
  - Email: Enter your email address.
  - Message: Provide a message.
  - Submit Button: Click to submit the form.

- **Form Validation:**
  - The email field is required and must be in a valid email format.
  - The message field is required and must be at least 10 characters long.

## Customization

- You can customize the dropdown options and behavior by modifying the JavaScript code in the `script.js` file.
- To change the form fields or add additional form fields, modify the HTML code in the `index.html` file.
- Update the CSS styles in the `styles.css` file to customize the appearance of the dropdown and form.
